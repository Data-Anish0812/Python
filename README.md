# eBay Laptop Web Scrapping
**eBay Laptop Web Scrapping** is a web scraper built using Python's BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to extract laptop names and prices from eBay listings. It allows users to fetch real-time data about the latest laptop prices, which can be used for price analysis and trend tracking. By scraping product details such as the laptop's name and its listed price, the project helps users monitor current market trends, identify price fluctuations, and analyze data for informed purchasing decisions. The collected information can be saved in a structured format, such as a CSV, for further analysis or reporting.
# EDA on Heart Disease dataset
In this project, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on a heart disease dataset, focusing on key features such as age, gender, heart disease status, and other relevant attributes. The analysis involved visualizing the distribution and relationships of these variables to uncover patterns and insights. Various plots, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots, were used to explore the dataset, with a particular focus on understanding the relationships between the numerical features. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights into how different factors contribute to heart disease, helping in the development of predictive models and supporting better health decision-making.
# Loan Information System
The **Loan Information System** is a user-friendly application built using Custom Tkinter, designed to collect and manage essential loan application data. Users can input details such as ID, gender, age, education, job, annual income, residential assets, luxury assets, loan amount, and loan term through interactive input fields. Once the information is submitted, it is directly stored in an Excel file. This Excel file is then seamlessly integrated with a Power BI dashboard via a BI gateway, enabling real-time data visualization and analysis. This system provides an efficient solution for loan data entry and reporting, making it ideal for financial institutions and loan management services.
