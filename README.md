#Quiz Bot
This project features a simple quiz bot created in Python that engages users by asking a series of questions and evaluating their responses. Using if-else statements, the bot provides immediate feedback on whether the answers are correct or incorrect. At the end of the quiz, it calculates and displays the user's score, offering a straightforward and interactive experience. The bot is designed to be easy to use, making it a great example of basic Python programming and user interaction. Users can run the script and participate in the quiz, enjoying a fun and educational challenge.
