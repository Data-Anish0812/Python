# eBay Laptop Web Scrapping
This project is a web scraper built using Python's BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries to extract laptop names and prices from eBay listings. It allows users to fetch real-time data about the latest laptop prices, which can be used for price analysis and trend tracking. By scraping product details such as the laptop's name and its listed price, the project helps users monitor current market trends, identify price fluctuations, and analyze data for informed purchasing decisions. The collected information can be saved in a structured format, such as a CSV, for further analysis or reporting.
# Titanic Dataset on EDA
This project provides a detailed analysis of the Titanic dataset, focusing on factors influencing passenger survival. It includes visualizations such as a bar chart displaying the survival count, a pie chart showing the proportion of survivors, a histogram representing the age distribution of passengers, and a breakdown of passengers by class (First, Second, and Third). Using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis highlights key trends and insights, such as the impact of passenger class, age, and survival rate, offering a deeper understanding of the demographic and socio-economic factors involved in the Titanic tragedy.
# Loan Information System
The **Loan Information System** is a user-friendly application built using Custom Tkinter, designed to collect and manage essential loan application data. Users can input details such as ID, gender, age, education, job, annual income, residential assets, luxury assets, loan amount, and loan term through interactive input fields. Once the information is submitted, it is directly stored in an Excel file.
